# CoverUp

CoverUp is a trivial but useful tool. It is primarily intended to cover up annoying advertising on web pages. We appreciate that advertising is essential to support many services such as websites. But advertising can be self-defeating. The timeout for human attention is roughly 7 seconds. If something distracts our attention during that time it may take us some time to recall our orriginal purpose for visiting a site. We may abandon the page entirely, not buying that widget or signing up for that service. See thehill.com for a prime example. 

For such sites, CoverUp allows a user to put up a cover over the page that can be used to hide the annoying reatures of the page. Menu options allow the cover to remain on the top of the page and to change the background color of the cover to black or white. The cover can be resized and will remember the settings for the next use.
